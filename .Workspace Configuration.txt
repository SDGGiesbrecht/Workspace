[_Begin Development Notes_]
### Running Forks & Branches

#### Locally

To test a fork of Workspace, run the following script in the test project’s root directory (replacing “user” with the owner of the fork):

```shell
rm -rf .Workspace
git clone https://github.com/user/Workspace .Workspace
```

To test a particular branch, run the following script in the test project’s root directory (replacing “branch-name” with a valid branch):

```shell
cd .Workspace
git checkout branch-name
cd ..
```

(If the `.Workspace` folder does not exist yet, double‐click `Refresh Workspace` first.)

To revert to normal behaviour, run the following:

```shell
rm -rf .Workspace
```

#### In Continuous Integration

To set continuous integration to run a test fork or branch, open `Refresh Workspace (manOS).command`...

```shell
open -a Xcode "Refresh Workspace (macOS).command"
```

...and follow the instructions in the comments halfway down.
