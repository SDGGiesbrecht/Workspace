[_Begin Development Notes_]
### Running Forks & Branches

#### Locally

To test a fork of Workspace, run the following script (replacing “user” with the owner of the fork):

```shell
WORKSPACE_INSTALLATION="$HOME/.Workspace/Workspace"
rm -rf $WORKSPACE_INSTALLATION
git clone https://github.com/user/Workspace $WORKSPACE_INSTALLATION
```

To test a particular branch, run the following script (replacing “branch-name” with a valid branch):

```shell
BRANCH="branch-name"
cd "$HOME/.Workspace/Workspace"
git checkout -b $BRANCH "origin/$BRANCH"
```

(If the `.Workspace` folder does not exist yet, double‐click `Refresh Workspace` first.)

To revert to normal behaviour, run the following:

```shell
rm -rf "$HOME/.Workspace"
```

#### In Continuous Integration

To set continuous integration to run a test fork or branch, open `Refresh Workspace (manOS).command`...

```shell
open -a Xcode "Refresh Workspace (macOS).command"
```

...and follow the instructions in the comments halfway down.

### Changes to Auto‐Generated Files

If changes are made which affect auto‐generated files like `.gitignore` or `.travis.yml`, continuous integration will always fail with the message “This project is out of date.”.

This is to be expected, because the same project cannot simultaneously satisfy the differing expectations of the stable and development versions of Workspace.

Once that is the only error remaining, contact an administrator the same as if everything were passing and mention the reason for the false failure report.
