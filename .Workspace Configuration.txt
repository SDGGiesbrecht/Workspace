[_Begin Development Notes_]
### Running Forks & Branches

#### Locally

To test a fork of Workspace, run the following script (replacing “user” with the owner of the fork):

```shell
WORKSPACE_INSTALLATION="$HOME/.Workspace/Workspace"
rm -rf $WORKSPACE_INSTALLATION
git clone https://github.com/user/Workspace $WORKSPACE_INSTALLATION
```

To test a particular branch, run the following script (replacing “branch-name” with a valid branch):

```shell
BRANCH="branch-name"
cd "$HOME/.Workspace/Workspace"
git checkout -b $BRANCH "origin/$BRANCH"
```

(If the `.Workspace` folder does not exist yet, double‐click `Refresh Workspace` first.)

To revert to normal behaviour, run the following:

```shell
rm -rf "$HOME/.Workspace"
```

#### In Continuous Integration

To set continuous integration to run a test fork or branch, open `Refresh Workspace (manOS).command`...

```shell
open -a Xcode "Refresh Workspace (macOS).command"
```

...and follow the instructions in the comments halfway down.
