## The Workspace Workflow

*The Workspace project is managed by... Workspace! So let’s try it out by following along using the Workspace project itself.*

### When the Repository Is Cloned

Workspace hides as much as it can from Git, so when a project using Workspace is pulled, pushed, or cloned...

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/Workspace
```

...only one small piece of Workspace comes with it: A short script called “Refresh” that comes in two variants, one for each operating system.

*Hmm... I wish I had more tools at my disposal... Hey! What if I...*

### Refresh the Workspace

To refresh the workspace, double‐click the `Refresh` script for the corresponding operating system. (If you are on Linux and double‐clicking fails or opens a text file, see [here](Documentation/Linux%20Notes.md#doubleclicking-scripts).)

`Refresh` opens a terminal window, and in it Workspace reports its actions while it sets the project folder up for development.

*This looks better. Let’s get coding!*

*[Add this... Remove that... Change something over here...]*

*...All done. I wonder if I broke anything while I was working? Hey! It looks like I can...*

### Validate Changes

When the project seems ready for a push, merge, or pull request, validate the current state of the project by double‐clicking the `Validate` script.

`Validate` opens a terminal window and in it Workspace runs the project through a series of checks.

When it finishes, it prints a summary of which tests passed and which tests failed.

*Oops! I never realized that would happen...*

### Summary

1. `Refresh` before working.
2. `Validate` when it looks complete.

*Wow! That was so much easier than doing it all manually!*

## Set‐Up

The following commands require a full install. (See [Installation](#installation).)

### Existing Projects

To have Workspace take responsibility for an existing project, run this command in the root of its repository:

```shell
workspace refresh
```

When it is added to an existing project, Workspace will refrain from most responsibilities by default, behaving in a primarily opt‐in manner. This setting can be [changed](Documentation/Responsibilities.md).

### New Projects

To have Workspace create a new Swift project from scratch, run one of the following commands in an empty folder:

To create a [library](Documentation/Project%20Types.md) project:
```shell
workspace initialize
```

To create an [application](Documentation/Project%20Types.md) project:
```shell
workspace initialize •type application
```

To create an [executable](Documentation/Project%20Types.md) project:
```shell
workspace initialize •type executable
```

When it creates a new project, Workspace will handle many responsibilities by default, behaving in a primarily opt‐out manner. This setting can be [changed](Documentation/Responsibilities.md).
