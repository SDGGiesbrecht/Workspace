# Configuring Workspace

Workspace can be configured by placing a text file called `.Workspace Configuration.txt` in the project root.

The basic syntax is as follows:

```
Option A: Simple Value

[_Begin Option B_]
Multiline
Value
[_End_]

(Comment)

((
    Multiline
    Comment
    ))
```

An option may be specified more than once, in which case the last instance overrides any previous instances.

## Sharing Configurations between Projects

A configuration file can import options from another repository:

```
[_Import https://github.com/user/repository_]
```

The referenced repository can be a real project or an otherwise empty repository, as long as it contains a `.Workspace Configuration.txt` file at its root.

Precedence rules still apply. The imported options can override any options before the import statement, and options that follow the import statement can override the imported options.
