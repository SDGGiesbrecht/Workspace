# Ignoring File Types

Workspace automatically skips files it does not understand, but it prints a warning first.

For standard file types, please [request that support be added](https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/Workspace/issues).

For non‐standard file types, the warning can be silenced using the [configuration](Configuring%20Workspace.md) option `Ignore File Types`. Each line is a separate entry:

```text
[_Begin Ignore File Types_]
jpg
mp3
[_End_]
```
