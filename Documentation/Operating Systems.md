# Operating Systems

By default, Workspace assumes projects support all available operating systems:

- `macOS`
- `Linux`
- `iOS`
- `watchOS`
- `tvOS`

Any of these can be disabled by adding the corresponding option to the [configuration file](Configuring Workspace.md):

```
Support Linux: False
```
