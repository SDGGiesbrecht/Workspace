# Proofreading

Workspace proofreads the project source during validation.

## In Xcode

Proofreading also works within Xcode, provided Workspace has been [fully installed](../README.md#installation) on the local device. (If not, proofreading will be skipped, and a link to installation instructions will be displayed.)

Workspace will set this up automatically if it is [in charge of Xcode](Xcode.md).

If Workspace is not in charge of Xcode, proofreading can still be activated for a project by manually adding the following “run script” build phase:

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.SDG/Registry:$PATH"
if which workspace > /dev/null ; then
    workspace proofread •use‐version 0.1.0
else
    echo "warning: Install Workspace if you wish to receive in‐code reports of style errors for this project. See https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/Workspace"
fi
```

## Disabling Rules

When Workspace triggers a warning, the name of the particular rule is always given in parentheses.

A rule can be disabled by adding the name of the rule to the [configuration](Configuring%20Workspace.md) option `Disable Proofreading Rules`.

`Disable Proofreading Rules` is a list separated by line breaks.

## SwiftLint

Workspace’s proofreading includes [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

By default, Workspace provides SwiftLint with a configuration that corresponds to its own. In this mode, SwiftLint rules can be treated as though they were Workspace rules. For example, they can be disabled the by listing them under `Disable Proofreading Rules`.

However, SwiftLint can instead be configured manually by placing a `.swiftlint.yml` file in the project root. In this mode, Workspace will no longer apply its own configuration to SwiftLint. That means, for example, that disabling SwiftLint rules by listing them under `Disable Proofreading Rules` will no longer work. For more information about `.swiftlint.yml`, see [SwiftLint’s own documentation](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).
