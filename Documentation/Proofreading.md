# Proofreading

Workspace proofreads the project source during validation.

```shell
$ workspace proofread
```

## In Xcode

Proofreading also works within Xcode, provided Workspace has been [fully installed](../README.md#installation) on the local device. (If not, proofreading will be skipped, and a link to installation instructions will be displayed.)

Workspace will set this up automatically if it is [in charge of Xcode](Xcode.md).

If Workspace is not in charge of Xcode, proofreading can still be activated for a project by manually adding the following “run script” build phase (replacing `0.0.0` with a valid version):

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.SDG/Registry:$PATH"
if which workspace > /dev/null ; then
    workspace proofread •xcode •use‐version 0.0.0
else
    echo "warning: Install Workspace if you wish to receive in‐code reports of style errors for this project. See https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/Workspace"
fi
```

## Disabling Rules

When Workspace triggers a warning, the name of the particular rule is always given in parentheses.

A rule can be disabled by adding the name of the rule to the [configuration](Configuring%20Workspace.md) option `Disable Proofreading Rules`.

`Disable Proofreading Rules` is a list separated by line breaks.

## SwiftLint

Workspace’s proofreading includes [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

By default, Workspace provides SwiftLint with a standard configuration that interoperates well with Workspace and the Swift Package Manager.

However, SwiftLint can instead be configured manually by placing a `.swiftlint.yml` file in the project root. If such a file is present, Workspace will not apply its own configuration to SwiftLint. For more information about `.swiftlint.yml`, see [SwiftLint’s own documentation](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).
