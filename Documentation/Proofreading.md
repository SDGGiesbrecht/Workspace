# Proofreading

Workspace proofreads the project source.

## Disabling Rules

When Workspace triggers a warning, the name of the particular rule is always given in parentheses.

A rule can be disabled by adding the name of the rule to the [configuration](Configuring Workspace.md) option `Disable Proofreading Rules`.

`Disable Proofreading Rules` is a list separated by line breaks.
