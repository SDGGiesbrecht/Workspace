# Scripts

Workspace provides workflow scripts to reduce refreshment and validation to a simple double‐click. These scripts will also ensure that the same version of Workspace gets used for the project on every machine it is cloned to.

This is controlled by the [configuration](Configuring%20Workspace.md) option `Provide Scripts`. The default value is `True`.

```shell
$ workspace refresh scripts
```
