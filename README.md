# Workspace

Workspace automates management of Swift projects.

## What Workspace Can Do

## Set‐Up

### New Projects

To have Workspace create a new Swift project from scratch, run this script in an empty folder:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/Workspace .Workspace
cd .Workspace
swift build --configuration release
cd ..
.Workspace/.build/release/workspace initialize
```

### Existing Projects

To have Workspace take responsibility for an existing project, run this script the root of its repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/Workspace .Workspace
cd .Workspace
swift build --configuration release
cd ..
.Workspace/.build/release/workspace refresh
```
