/// Options related to file headers.
///
/// ```shell
/// $ workspace refresh file‐headers
/// ```
///
/// A file header is a commented section at the top of each file in a project. Typical uses for file headers include:
///
/// - Identifing which project the file belongs to.
/// - Indicating copyright.
/// - Providing licence reminders.
///
/// ### Precise Definition of a File Header
///
/// Because Workspace overwrites existing file headers, it is important to know how Workspace identifies them.
///
/// Workspace considers any comment that starts a file to be a file header, with the following constraints:
///
/// A file header may be a single block comment:
///
/// ```swift
/// /*
///  This is a header.
///  This is more of the same header.
///  */
/// /* This is not part of the header. */
/// ```
///
/// Alternatively, a file header may be a continous sequence of line comments:
///
/// ```swift
/// // This is a header.
/// // This is more of the same header.
///
/// // This is not part of the header.
/// ```
///
/// Documentation comments are never headers.
///
/// ```swift
/// /**
///  This is not a header.
///  */
/// ```
///
/// In shell scripts, the shebang line precedes the header and is not part of it.
///
/// ```shell
/// #!/bin/bash ← This is not part of the header.
///
/// # This is a header
/// ```

    public var manage: Bool = false

    /// The copyright notice.
    ///
    /// By default, this is assembled from the other documentation and licence options.
    ///
    /// Workspace will replace the dynamic element `#dates` with the file’s copyright dates. (e.g. “©2016–2017”).
    ///
    /// ### Determination of the Dates
    ///
    /// Workspace uses any pre‐existing start date if it can detect one already in the file header. Workspace searches for `©`, `(C)`, or `(c)` followed by an optional space and four digits. If none is found, Workspace will use the current date as the start date.
    ///
    /// Workspace always uses the current date as the end date.
