## Step 1: Report

From the smallest typo to the severest crash, whether you are reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, whether you already have a solution in mind or not, please **always start by reporting it**.

Please search the [existing issues](../../issues) to see if something related has already been reported.

- If there is already a related issue, please join that conversation and share any additional information you have.
- Otherwise, open a [new issue](../../issues/new).

Even if you think you have the solution, please **do not start working on it** until you hear from one of the project administrators. This may save you some work in the event that someone else is already working on it, or if your idea ends up deemed beyond the scope of the project goals.

## Step 2: Branch

If you have [reported](#step-1-report) your idea and an administrator has given you the green light, follow these steps to get a local copy you can work on.

1. **Fork the repository** by clicking “Fork” in the top‐right of the repository page. (Skip this step if you have been given write access.)
2. **Create a local clone**.
3. **Create a development branch**. `git checkout -b some‐new‐branch‐name`
4. **Set up the workspace** by double‐clicking `Refresh` in the root folder. (If your system is set to *edit* scripts instead of *execute* them, you may have to execute the file from a terminal instead.)

Now you are all set to try out your idea.

## Step 3: Submit

Once you have your idea working properly, follow these steps to submit your changes.

1. **Validate your changes** by double‐clicking `Validate` in the root folder.
2. **Commit your changes**. `git commit -m "Some description of the changes."`
3. **Push your changes**. `git push`
4. **Submit a pull request** by clicking “New Pull Request” in the branch list on GitHub.
5. **Wait for continuous integration** to complete its validation.
6. **Request a review** from an administrator by clicking the gear in the top right of the pull request page.
