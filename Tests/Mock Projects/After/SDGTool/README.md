# SDG

A package.

### Example Usage

```swift
// 🇨🇦EN
```

## Installation

SDG provides command line tools.

They can be installed any way Swift packages can be installed. The most direct method is pasting the following into a terminal, which will either install or update them:

```shell
curl -sL https://gist.github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/4d76ad2f2b9c7bf9072ca1da9815d7e2/raw/update.sh | bash -s SDG "https://github.com/JohnDoe/SDG" 1.0.0 "tool help" tool werkzeug
```

## Importing

SDG provides a library for use with the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Simply add SDG as a dependency in `Package.swift`:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/JohnDoe/SDG", from: Version(1, 0, 0)),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
            .productItem(name: "Library", package: "SDG"),
        ])
    ]
)
```

The module can then be imported in source files:

```swift
import Library
```
