$ workspace document help •no‐colour

workspace document generates API documentation.

By default, the generated documentation will be placed in a “docs” folder at the project root. The GitHub settings described in the following link can be adjusted to automatically host the documentation directly from the repository.

https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#publishing-your-github-pages-site-from-a-docs-folder-on-your-master-branch

(If you wish to avoid checking generated files into “master”, see the documentation of the “encryptedTravisCIDeploymentKey” configuration option for a more advanced method.)
