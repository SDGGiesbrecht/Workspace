$ workspace refresh continuous‐integration help •no‐colour

workspace refresh continuous‐integration regenerates the project’s continuous integration configuration files.

Workspace will create a “.travis.yml” file at the project root, which configures Travis CI to run all the tests from “Validate” on every operating system supported by the project.

Note: Workspace cannot turn Travis CI on. It is still necessary to log into Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org) and activate it for the project’s repository.

Special Thanks:

• Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org)

• Kyle Fuller and Swift Version Manager (https://github.com/kylef/swiftenv), which makes continuous integration possible on Linux.
