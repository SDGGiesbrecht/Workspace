$ workspace refresh examples help •no‐colour

workspace refresh examples synchronizes the project’s compiled examples.

When APIs change, it is easy to forget to update any examples in the documentation. Workspace allows examples to be synchronized with real, compiled source code in a test module. That way, when an API change makes an example invalid, it will be caught by the compiler.

Examples can be defined anywhere in the project, but usually the best place for them is in a test module.

To define an example, place it between “@example(identifier)” and “@endExample”. Anything on the same line as either token will be ignored (such as “//”).

func forTheSakeOfLeavingTheGlobalScope() {
    let a = 0
    let b = 0
    let c = 0

    // @example(symmetry)
    if a == b {
        assert(b == a)
    }
    // @endExample

    // @example(transitivity)
    if a == b ∧ b == c {
        assert(a == c)
    }
    // @endExample
}

To use an example in a symbol’s documentation, add one or more instances of “#example(0, identifier)” to the line immediately preceding the documentation.

// #example(1, symmetry) #example(2, transitivity)
/// Returns `true` if `lhs` is equal to `rhs`.
///
/// Equality is symmetrical:
///
/// ```swift
/// (Workspace will automatically fill these in whenever the project is refreshed.)
/// ```
///
/// Equality is transitive:
///
/// ```swift
///
/// ```
func == (lhs: Thing, rhs: Thing) -> Bool {
    return lhs.rawValue == rhs.rawValue
}
