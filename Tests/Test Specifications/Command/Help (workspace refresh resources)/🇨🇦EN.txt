$ workspace refresh resources help •no‐colour

workspace refresh resources regenerates code providing access to the project’s resources.

Workspace can embed resources in Swift package targets.

Workspace will find and embed any file located within a project’s “Resources” directory. The structure of the “Resources” directory reflects the targets and namespaces under which the resources will be available in Swift code. Immediate subdirectories must correspond to targets; optional deeper nested directories produce namespaces. For example, a project with the following file...

Resources/MyLibrary/Templates/Basic Template.txt

...can use the file from within the “MyLibrary” target like this...

let template: String = Resoures.Templates.basicTemplate
print(template)

By default, files are embedded as “Data”, but some file extensions will be recognized and given a more specific Swift type (such as “.txt” embedded as “String”).
