$ workspace refresh scripts help •no‐colour

workspace refresh scripts regenerates the project’s refresh and validation scripts.

Linux may require some additional set‐up before the generated scripts work with a double‐click. This applies to both “Refresh (Linux).sh” and “Validate (Linux).sh”.

Solutions to common errors are found below.

If the necessary fix is undesirable, it is possible to run these scripts from a terminal instead. (See the bottom of this page.)

• Error: The Script Opens in a Text Editor

Linux needs to be set to run executable scripts when they are double‐clicked instead of opening them to edit.

On Ubuntu, the setting is found at:

“Files” → “Edit” → “Preferences” → “Behavior” → “Run execuatable text files when they are opened”

• Error: Swift Is Unavailable

Because the script opens a new terminal to display its output, brand‐new terminal sessions need to be able to find the `swift` command without additional set‐up.

To register the location of `swift` even for new terminal sessions, run the following command, substituting the real location of the Swift install.

$ echo 'export PATH=/path/to/swift-0.0.0-RELEASE-ubuntu00.00/usr/bin:"${PATH}"' >>~/.profile

If Swift is not even istalled yet, see the Swift website for instructions: https://swift.org/download/

• Running from a Terminal

While double‐clicking is usually the most convenient, it can be bypassed by manually running the macOS equivalent from a terminal:

$ "./Refresh (macOS).command"

This is exactly what the Linux script does internally. It just opens a new terminal window first to display the output.
